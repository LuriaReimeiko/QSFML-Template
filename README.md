# Stripped Commented version
A version which will by default have an empty window appear at the center of your main screen, taking up 80% of the available screen space.

Logic is written and heavily commented for a custom widget named QSFML which is inherits for sf::RenderWindow and is usable by SFML.

**For an uncommented version of this, see branch Stripped**
