# QSFML Template
A template for using Qt6 alongside SFML3.
- Is compatible with : Qt5.x Qt 6.x SFML2.x SFML3.x
- Is **NOT** compatible with : Qt4.x and below SFML1.x and below


For SFML 1.6, see [this](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/graphics-qt.php).
This may also work with lower SFML versions, but I **cannot** guarantee this.

## Various versions
See all branches for more information.
